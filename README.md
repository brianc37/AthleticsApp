Dover Area School District Athletics App By: DeVaughn Clauser and Brian Chamberlain
  Currently, the Dover Area High School doesnâ€™t have a dedicated athletics section. Anyone involved has to fumble around a multitude of 
websites and the athletic office to find everything involving them. The audience of this app is primarily the citizens, teachers, and 
students of Dover. With this app, Dover citizens will be able to keep track of the large number of sporting events happening in or with 
the Dover teams. The players and coaches would greatly appreciate an increased number of fans attending their events, which will bring the 
community closer together by allowing members outside the school a greater opportunity to get involved. Teachers can use this app in order 
to better schedule homework, tests, etc around the often tight schedule of their students, bringing an elevated level of respect between 
student and teacher. Finally, the most common attendee of a sporting event is the student of Dover. If they had a spot to find all the 
info they needed they could create a morale-boosting effect by cheering on their teammates in class and on the field, this could even 
breath new life into Dover sports teams.
  The overall aim of this app is to allow people easier access to information on Dover High School athletics by consolidating it into 
one place rather than spaced around multiple means and improve the quality of athletic participation at Dover.
