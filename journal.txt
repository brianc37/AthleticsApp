5/3/18 - This week we started the core files and interface of our app. We also set up our GitHub with a system of a main branch and two seperate branches for each of us in order to keep our development organized and keep our main app bug free. The biggest challenge this week has been beginning site scraping. Our app continues to throw an error that has no solutions on the developers website and none of the online fixes have worked. We are going to continue to work on keeping the development process as organized as possible and are going to try to continue to keep a good pace with the app while having hit this error wall.
